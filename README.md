## System Architecture

The Enchanted Library system is built using a modular architecture:

- **Models**: Core data structures (Book, User, Lending)
- **Patterns**: Implementation of design patterns
- **Services**: Business logic services
- **Security**: Access control and authentication
- **UI**: User interfaces (CLI and GUI)

## Design Patterns

The system implements various design patterns:

### Creational Patterns

- **Factory Pattern**: Create book and user objects
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensure a single central catalog
- **Builder Pattern**: Create customized book entries

### Structural Patterns

- **Facade Pattern**: Provide a simplified library interface
- **Adapter Pattern**: Integrate legacy data
- **Decorator Pattern**: Add features dynamically

### Behavioral Patterns

- **Observer Pattern**: Notify about library events
- **Strategy Pattern**: Implement different lending rules
- **Command Pattern**: Allow undoable actions
- **State Pattern**: Track book status

## Object-Oriented Principles

The system demonstrates core OOP principles:

- **Encapsulation**: Private attributes with getters/setters
- **Inheritance**: Book and User hierarchies
- **Polymorphism**: Different implementations of abstract methods
- **Abstraction**: High-level interfaces hiding implementation details
